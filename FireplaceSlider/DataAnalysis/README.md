# Fireplace Slider Data Analysis

## Overview

These folders are various data analysis files for the fireplace slider project. Each folder is a self contained analysis that can be run independently. By a byproduct of this, there is code duplication between folders. This is intentional as it makes it easier to run the analysis independently. Raw and processed data is stored in the `data` folder. Outputs are stored in the `outputs` folder.

## Usage

Each folder has `.py` files that start with a letter, run these in alphabetical order.

I started with numbers, but that was a bad idea, as it prevent importing between files.
